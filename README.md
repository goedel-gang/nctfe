# nctfe

This is an implementation of the 2048 game in Python, building up to a Python
`curses` interface. Named `nctfe` in the spirit of `ncdu` and `ncmpc` and so on.

Doesn't do anything so clever as tracking high scores or saving games yet,
regrettably.

Also features preposterously large boards and autoplay mode so you can make
impressive screenshots like this:

This mode is best leveraged with PyPy.
